1. A banking institution requires actionable insights into mortgage-backed 
securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis.

2. The mortgage bank would like to identify potential monthly mortgage 
expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental 
of the real estate. 

3. A statistical model needs to be created to predict the potential demand 
for amount of loan in dollars for each of the region in the USA. Also, 
there is a need to create a dashboard which would refresh periodically, 
post data retrieval from the agencies.

4. The dashboard must demonstrate relationships and trends for the key 
metrics as follows: number of loans, average rental income, monthly 
mortgage and owner’s cost, family income vs mortgage cost 
comparison across different regions. The metrics described here do 
not limit the dashboard to these few.

Also, there is a need to create a dashboard which would refresh periodically post data retrieval from the agencies. This would help to monitor the key metrics and trends.

The dashboard must demonstrate relationships and trends for the key metrics as follows:  number of loans, average rental income, monthly mortgage and owner’s cost, family income vs mortgage cost comparison across different regions. The metrics are described not to limit the dashboard to these few only.
